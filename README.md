# data-stories

Hey, Dom. So the more I’m thinking about data stories that we could tell, the more I think that it would be best if we started on a project I’ve been working on called “The Anatomy of Seinfeld.” It’s a kind of quantitative breakdown of the “Seinfeld formula.” First off, if you’re not a fan of Seinfeld and you don’t find this interesting I can find another story. I’m not sure exactly what you want to get out of this, whether it’s experience with d3.js or telling a really riveting story, so just let me know if you’d rather do something with larger data sets. 
I originally wanted to do something on a correlation between ADHD and the length, amount of commercial breaks in plays/television shows, but I really couldn’t find any good data sets. I found some and they all showed a huge jump in the ‘80s and ‘90s, which is almost entirely due to better diagnostic techniques. But as for advertising influencing that, I mean we’ve had advertising in television since the ‘50s. Maybe I can resurrect it later, but that thesis was crushed for now. 
So let me just outline “The Anatomy of Seinfeld” and you can tell me whether or not you find it interesting.

The point of this story is to expose the “Seinfeld formula,” or at least get a good understanding of how timing and carefully-arranged plot structures are pieced together for an episode of Seinfeld. 
In each episode of Seinfeld there are either three or four plot lines. Each plot line has a variable based on literary value. They would be: 
A = Goal-oriented plot. There is always only one of these in an episode. 
B = Whim/ramification plot. 
C = Personal antagonistic plot. 
B and C plots fill the three or two plots around an A plot. All of the plots can actually be plotted on a time chart. There are five blocks of time associated with a Seinfeld episode. I have to find it in my notes, but I’ve plotted it before. So you can actually predict which type a plot will be by noticing the time it was introduced. Some of this I’ve read about but a lot has been me taking apart episodes. 
So I’ve been slowly chipping away at this. I think it would be cool to design a model that lets a person compare the episodes and really gives them a tangible understanding of the “Seinfeld Formula.” My first idea was pretty rudimentary in that you clicked an episode, that episode showed you a kind of flowchart with all of the plot lines arranged along a timeline. 

So just let me know what you think. I still have to get more data (take apart more episodes) and I guess design the actual model that we'll use with d3.js. But I think it’s a worthy project. No hard feelings if you want to do something with bigger and more numeric data sets. Just let me know!
